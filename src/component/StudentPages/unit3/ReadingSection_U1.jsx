There are some people who like to think about the future. They are building a museum. It will be called the Museum of Future Inventions.",
    "This museum will show scientists' ideas about future technology. There will be tiny phones, and their screens will be projected. There will be new computers and games at this museum. Some of the items won't actually work because they haven't been invented yet! But they will be possibilities for the future. There will be a large room like a library of the future. Do you think there will be more books or more computers in that room? There will be ideas for a future cinema at this museum too. There will even be an idea room for students. They will be able to give their ideas for future inventions. The museum will choose the best ideas and put them in the museum. Is there an idea that you would like to send to the Museum of Future Inventions?",
